## Section 5 Console Log

`console.log` is used to display content to the **JavaScript console**. Run the following code in the console:

```
console.log("hiya friend!");
Prints: "hiya friend!"
```

The message you’ve logged is "hiya friend!".` hiya friend!` is a **string** (a sequence of characters).

#### Optional demo example

Let’s use `console.log` to do something a little more interesting. Here’s a block of JavaScript code that loops through the numbers 0 through 9 and prints them out to the console:
```
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
Prints:
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

This is called a **loop**.

Based on this loop's settings, any code written inside the curly brackets `{...}` will be repeated 10 times. In this case, `console.log` is printing out the value of `i` each time the loop runs. 

## JavaScript Demo

`document.getElementsByTagName("h1")[0].style.color = "#ff0000";`

changes the `h1` on the page to red
