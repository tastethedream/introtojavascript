# Lesson 2 Data Types & Variables

## Section 2 Numbers

Defining a number in JavaScript is actually pretty simple. The Number data type includes any positive or negative integer, as well as decimals. Entering a number into the console will return it right back to you.

`3 `
> Returns: 3

There, you did it.

### Arithmetic operations

You can also perform calculations with numbers pretty easily. Basically type out an expression the way you would type it in a calculator.

`3 + 2.1`

 > Returns: 5.1

 ### Comparing Numbers

 `5 > 10`
> Returns: false

`5 < 10`>
Returns: true

`5 == 10`
> Returns: false

Comparisons between numbers will either evaluate to true or false.
